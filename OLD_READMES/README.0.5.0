This is release 0.5.0 of the  Oracle Odbc Driver originally
developed by EasySoft LTD - www.easysoft.com.  They eventally
lost interest in maintaining the code, it has been picked up
by me (Dennis Box, dbox@fnal.gov).  Contributions to this
effort (patches, fixes, observations not $$$) are welcomed.

A project page is currently at fndapl.fnal.gov/~dbox/oracle/odbc/
The cvs $Ids of the files in this release are in a file
called 'manifest' in this directory

Changes from 0.4.0pre1:

+Transaction, commit, rollback support enabled.

+Extensive tracing capabilities added, set DEBUG environment
 variable to some integer, the higher the number the chattier
 it gets.

+Binding of various datatypes fixed.

+Test suite added.

-----------------------------------------------------
To build, test, and run:

This release has been fairly well tested on Red Hat Linux 6.5
and 7.1 using oracle 8.05 through 9.2.  The auto-config files
may have problems for other architectures and I would welcome
contributions to fix these types of problems.  That said,
configure, make, make install, and make check all should work
as they do on GNU projects.  If this fails, see the configure_local
script in this directory for configure options that I use.

See the 'bootstrap'  script in this directory if both configure
and configure_local fail to re-build the automake files for
your local environment.

There is a problem right now with the 'make check' target, 
make install has to be run first, thats right you have to 
install it before you can test it which should be fixed.  If
you know how,  please drop me a line.  To successfully run
make check several environment variables need to be set up
first, see test/check_oracle_environment for details.

                           Easysoft Oracle ODBC Driver
                           ===========================

Installation instructions for unix platforms.


Binary Distributions
********************

Both rpm and tar.gz binary distributions default to install under the 
/usr/local tree. rpms can be installed as follows

# rpm -Uhv oracle-0.x.x-x.rpm

.tar.gz packages can be installed on most systems using
# cd /
# gzip -dc <path to>/oracle-0.x.x-x.rpm | tar xvf -


Building from Source
********************

For dependencies and instructions on obtaining the source code please refer to 
the README.

If you have obtained a version directly from the CVS repositiory you should
cd to the oracle directory and issue;
$ make -f Makefile.cvs

In most cases the configure script will be able to determine the necessary 
information in order to compile. The following command line options may be
useful.

 --with-unixODBC[=DIR]  This is useful if the unixODBC driver manager libraries
     have been installed outside of the system library path.

 --without-unixODBC  Configure without looking for the unixODBC headers or 
     libraries. You will need to provide the include and linking mechanisms
	 for odbc in some other way.
     
 --with-oraclehome[=DIR] If you do not have the ORACLE_HOME environment
     variable set or wish to override it, this specifies the root of the
     Oracle product installation (typically /oracle/product/8.1.5)

 --prefix=DIR indicates that the driver should be installed under a directory
     tree other than /usr/local
 
 --enable-trace[=yes|no] this enables/disables ODBC tracing. Even with tracing
     turned off it can be a significance performance hit if compiled in, so
     this options should be considered akin to a debug option.
	
 --enable-user-catalog[=yes|no] A call to SQLTables on the standard Oracle 
     catalog (ALL_CATALOG table) returns around 5000 rows even before user
	 entities are taken into account. Many applications will never need 
	 catalog data about these entites, and using the user_ tables rather
	 than the all_ views/tables can vastly reduce the cost of catalog 
	 functions.

 --enable-symbol-hack[=yes|no] some versions of the Oracle client library 
     have an undefined symbol in them (slpmprodstab). This workaround defines
	 this symbol as an integer in the driver. This *seems* to work, but it
	 should not be considered a safe workaround.

After a successful configuration, you should simply be able to issue a make
and make install.
$ make
$ make install

Please be aware that this code is under constant development, hence the latest
code from CVS and possibly the latest snapshot release may not function
correctly and may not even compile correctly on your platform.
You are welcome to contribute to the development effort :- please see the end
of the README. :)


Configuration
*************

After the driver has been installed, it will need to be entered into your
driver manager's configuration and data source(s) added. As yet there is no
GUI configuration library (if someone would like to write one...) so this will
have to be done either with a tool such as odbcinst or manually.

For unixODBC you need to add the driver to odbcinst.ini. If you have used the
default prefix of /usr/local, you can cut and paste the following onto the
end of odbcinst.ini or use it as a template for the odbcinst utility. If you
have installed the library somewhere other than /usr/local, you will need to
edit the following accordingly.

[oracle-driver]
Description     = Easysoft Oracle Driver
Driver          = /usr/local/lib/liboraodbc.so
Setup           = 
FileUsage       = 1

For installation of a data source, again the following can be be either 
appended to the relevent odbc.ini or used as a template for the odbcinst
utility. Most people will need to edit the database identifier (DB), the 
user name (USER) and password (PASSWORD). None of these parameters are
required and can all in fact be overridden on the connection string 
(DB,UID,PWD).
Both Trace and TraceFile are ignored if tracing is not compiled in (as in 
binary versions). More information is given in the FAQ.

[oracle]
Driver = oracle-driver
Description = 
DB = global.database.id
USER = scott
PASSWORD = tiger
Trace = No
TraceFile = Yes

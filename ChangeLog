                    Easysoft Oracle ODBC Driver ChangeLog
                    =====================================

The latest changes in cvs are also documented at:
http://home.fnal.gov/~dbox/oracle/odbc/devlog.html 

begin dbox@fnal.gov (and contributers)  changes:

2004/12/01
	Changes to SQLBindCol (was incorrectly setting an 
	internal flag to SQL_NULL_DATA) and SQLSetStmtAttr (was
	NOT resetting internals when SQL_ATTR_ROWS_FETCHED_PTR
	indicated it should).  These changes make the driver work
	*much* better with libodbc++, so much that a new release
	is warranted. 

2004/8/2
     Unit tests modified to exercise SQLCancel, SQLColumns, SQLGetStmtAttr,
     SQLParamData, SQLPutData

2004/6/11 Changes contributed by Steven Reynolds , sreynolds@bradmark.com

   1. Fixes to SQLColumns.c and oracle_functions.c to clean 
	up some size/type mismatches that resulted in core dumps. 

2004/6/10
   1. Changes to SQLDriverConnect.c and SQLConnect.c to take a
      closer look at the odbc.ini file, if it exists, to look
      for username, password, and database.  Different ini files
      'in the wild' sometimes say DB=, sometimes DATABASE=, 
      sometimes USER=, or UID= so this should catch them. I hope.

2004/05/05
   1. Changes to return codes for SQLExectDirect for bad select statements.

2003/12/15 Changes contributed by Steven Reynolds , sreynolds@bradmark.com

   1. SQLFreeHandle.c: Change order of frees in _SQLFreeHandle(). 
      Free oci_stmt handle first before other oci handles. Oracle OCI 
      code was touching freed memory.
   2. SQLGetConnectAttr.c: SQLGetConnectAttr() was setting the commit mode.
   3. SQLGetDiagRec.c: Remove call to ood_clear_diag in SQLGetDiagRec(). 
      Otherwise client code was unable to get log messges.
   4. diagnostics.c: ood_post_diag() is allocates new error nodes, but code 
      didn't set all fields. Change malloc to calloc.
   5. oracle_functions.c: ood_driver_prepare() allocated a new oci 
      statement with out freeing the existing one.
   6. oracle_functions.c: ocivnu_sqlslong() passed to OCI code sizeof(long), 
      but buflen was 4. This failed on Tru64 where sizeof(long) is 8. 
      Change to pass min of these two values. Same in ocivnu_sqlulong(). 

2003/02/11 fixed a problem with array inserts, SQLSetStmtAttr and 
SQLGetStmtAttr for parameters SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE and 
SQL_ATTR_PARAM_BIND_TYPE are now functional

2003/02/10 change off-by-one error in month i/o for dates. Thanks to 
Gordon.Read@ranplc.co.uk

2003/02/03 added some data types that SQLColumns can identify

2003/01/30 Fixes for SQLColAttributes and underlying oracle_functions.c 
to return correct values for most column types when given SQL_DESC_TYPE 
or SQL_DESC_TYPE_NAME inputs. Fixed unit tests to reflect this new behavior

2003/01/18 Fixed unit tests to work on solaris, configure/make mostly 
works on solaris except that gmake fails until ltmain.sh is made executable 
with chmod+x

2003/01/17 Contributions by Robin Whitworth, rwhit@goldwiretech.com

   1. SQLFetch.c - There was a bug in SQLFetch() if row_status_ptr is not set.
   2. SQLPrimaryKeys.c - There was a join constraint missing in the query. Also, the results were not being ordered correctly.
   3. common.c,h; oracle_functions.c - in ood_driver_execute_describe, the 
      address of the data_size field of an implementation row descriptor 
      (IR_TAG) is being passed to OCIAttrGet for the OCI_ATTR_DATA_SIZE 
      attribute. This should be a ub2, not a ub4. (Probably works OK on 
      linux due to differing byte ordering. Fails miserably on solaris). 
      I changed the definition in common.h & the initializations in 
      common.c & oracle_functions.c
   4. . common.h - the macro GLOBAL_MUTEX_LOCK was wrong. It was doing an 
      unlock! Our code uses 4 or more database threads and this caused 
      the lexer to break.
   5. sqllex.l - the lexer was stripping newlines. This caused problems 
      where the only whitespace between to tokens was a newline. I modified 
      it to preserve newlines - oracle handles them fine, so no need to 
      strip or convert them.

2003/01/06 fix for "constructor" of ip_tag and ap_tag, filter out 
      trailing semicolons from sql as the minos source code is chock 
      full of them. Added functionality to SQLGetInfo
2002/12/11 Automake and config cleanups contributed by 
      Stefan.Radman@ctbto.org also a bug fix to ocivnu_sqlnts in 
      oracle_functions.c
2002/11/14 Changed various unimplemented functions/attributes to 
      return SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO and a IM001 status message instead of 
      SQL_ERROR. My reading of the documentation leads me to believe this 
      is the correct behavior.

2002/08/13 Fixed problem with unit-test of array inserts. All 19 unit 
tests report success now. The array inserts work properly and
probably always have, my unit test died on an assertion after informing 
the driver that it was about to perform an array insert. 
Cleaned up SQLGetInfo and SQLSetStmtAttr, gettting rid of lots of 
ugly #ifdefs while retaining functionality they supported. 

2002/06/26 fixed bind problem in oracle_functions.c which bound 
string characters with incorrect buffer length. Bound string inserts now
work properly. 

2002/06/24 Installed extensive tracing facilities. Setenv DEBUG 2 
reports on all SQLxxx functions called along with input parameters and
return status. Setenv DEBUG 3 reports on all OCIxxx functions 
called along with input parameters and return status. 

2002/06/06 fixed LD_PRELOAD/core dump problem for oracle 8.1.6 and 8.1.7 

2002/05/31 added reasonable comments to the unit tests fixed SQLPrepare 
so that it allocates space in the statement for the column ap
and ir descriptors instead of waiting for SQLBindCol to do it. 
This defect was causing libodbc++ (and hence RDBC) to core dump. 

2002/05/24 fixed a buffer overflow in getinfo1.c unit test program 

2002/05/23 refinements to unit tests, detect oracle client version and 
warn of 8.1.6/7 bug 

2002/05/22 more test tweaking, added a unit test to check for all the 
unixODBC and ORACLE environment setup that must happen prior
to the c programs in the test subdirectory executing successfully. 

2002/05/16 new unit test to exercise SQLGetInfo.c more fully, tests all 
valid inputs at the level of 'it accepts them and doesnt core dump'.
Testing all 177 valid inputs for correct functioning will take some effort! 

2002/05/14 bug fixes to some malloc/free code, added 'constructors' 
for ar and ir environment handles and asserts to try to catch struct
corruption at earliest possible time. 

2002/05/09 changed/added some unit tests 

2002/05/02 fixed unused var warnings and flow of control problems 
found by insure++ 

2002/04/03 SQLGetInfo.c now correctly reports that it supports transactions 
more testing of transaction capability 

2002/03/08 added commit/rollback capability through SQLEndTran, more 
tests for SQLColAttribute 

2002/03/06 took out spurious warning about stubbed function in SQLRowCount.c 
Changed oracle_functions.c to deal with float(126) and
integer (actually NUMBER(38,0) more correctly. 

2002/03/05 added functionality to oracle_functions.c more extensive 
testing of SQLColAttribute and SQLDescribeCol 

2002/02/26 more directory cleanup, remove generated files (i.e. Makefile) 
that automake should take care of from repository. 

2002/02/23 added some missing cases to the switch statement of 
SQLColAttribute.c 

2002/02/20 changed error reporting for stubbed out functions. Added 
function calls to unit tests in 'test' subdirectory. 

2002/02/11 rearranged project into subdirectories, featuring ./src 
and ./test subdirectories and re-worked Makefile.am Makefile.in etc.
Changed malloc/realloc/free function calls to GNU-style ORAMALLOC, 
ORAREALLOC, and ORAFREE macros which should
prevent double-freeing, or proceeding if memory is exhausted.

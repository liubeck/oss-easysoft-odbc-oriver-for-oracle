The Oracle Driver is still far from complete. Among the tasks left are
(in no particular order)...

 Bookmarks.

 LOBs, LONGs, SQLParamData and SQLPutData

 National Language Support (WCHARS). 

 Transactions. (DONE!!!!!! dbox)

 Bulk Operations. (started, bulk reads seem to work dbox)

 The rest of the handle attribute/field/recs functions.

 SQLSpecialColumns(SQL_BEST_ROWID,...) always returns ROWID. ROWID is not 
 always valid. A quick and easy method of testing its validity is needed.

 SQLStatistics completely ignores SQL_QUICK and SQL_ENSURE.

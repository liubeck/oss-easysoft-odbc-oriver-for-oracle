      <P>
        The Modifications which You create or to which You

        including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code
        version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
        terms of this License or a future version of this License
        released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy
        of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
        distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
        Source Code version that alters or restricts the
        applicable version of this License or the recipients'
        rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional

      <P>
        Any Modification which You create or to which You
        contribute must be made available in Source Code form
        under the terms of this License either on the same media
        as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
        Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
        Executable version available; and if made available via
        Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available
        for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
        initially became available, or at least six (6) months
        after a subsequent version of that particular
        Modification has been made available to such recipients.
        You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
        version remains available even if the Electronic
        Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

        create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You
        must include a prominent statement that the Modification
        is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
        provided by the Initial Developer and including the name
        of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b)
        in any notice in an Executable version or related

          (a) Third Party Claims.
        </H5>
        <P>
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
          third party's intellectual property rights is required
          to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
          under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a
          text file with the Source Code distribution titled
          "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making
          the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
          knowledge after the Modification is made available as
          described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
          modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes
          available thereafter and shall take other steps (such
          as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
          Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
        </P>

          (b) Contributor APIs.
        </H5>
        <P>
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application
          programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
          patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
          implement that API, Contributor must also include this
          information in the LEGAL file.

          (c) Representations.

        <P>
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
          pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes
          that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's
          original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
          rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

        3.5. Required Notices.
      </H4>
      <P>
        You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
        of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such
        notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
        structure, then You must include such notice in a
        location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
        would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created
        one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
        Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You
        must also duplicate this License in any documentation for
        the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or
        ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose
        to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
        recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only
        on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
        Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
        clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or
        liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
        hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
        Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
        Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
        support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
      </H4>
      <P>
        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
        if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
        that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
        that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is
        available under the terms of this License, including a
        description of how and where You have fulfilled the
        obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
        conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
        version, related documentation or collateral in which You
        describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code.
        You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code
        or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which
        may contain terms different from this License, provided
        that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
        and that the license for the Executable version does not
        attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
        Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
        License. If You distribute the Executable version under a
        different license You must make it absolutely clear that
        any terms which differ from this License are offered by
        You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
        Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
        Developer and every Contributor for any liability
        incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
        a result of any such terms You offer.

      <P>
        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code
        with other code not governed by the terms of this License
        and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
        such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
        License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

      4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

    <P>
      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms
      of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered
      Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You
      must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
      maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations
      and the code they affect. Such description must be included
      in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
      included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except
      to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
      description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient
      of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

      5. Application of this License.

        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular

        under the terms of that version. You may also choose to
        use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
        version of the License published by Easysoft. No one
        other than Easysoft has the right to modify the terms

        (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which
        is not already Covered Code governed by this License),
        You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
        "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL",

        phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
        your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
        make it clear that Your version of the license contains
        terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
        Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the
        Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the

      7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
    </H3>
    <P>
      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS''
      BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
      IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE
      COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
      THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH
      YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
      RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
      CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
      REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
      CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
      DISCLAIMER.
    </P>
    <H3>
      8. TERMINATION.
    </H3>
    <P>
      8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
      herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
      becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any
      termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
      this License shall survive.
    </P>
    <P>
      8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
      infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions)
      against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
      Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action
      is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
    </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>
        (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
        indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
        granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1
        and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
        from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
        within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
        agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable
        reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
        Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
        Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor
        Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of
        notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are
        not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the
        litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
        Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
        automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day
        notice period specified above.
      </P>
      <P>
        (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such
        Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
        infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by
        such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
        revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
        sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by
        that Participant.
      </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against
      Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor
      Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
      such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
      prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
      Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into
      account in determining the amount or value of any payment
      or license.
    </P>
    <P>
      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2
      above, all end user license agreements (excluding
      distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted
      by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.
    </P>
    <H3>
      9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
    </H3>
    <P>
      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
      TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
      YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
      DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH
      PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
      GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,
      OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
      SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
      SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
      TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
      SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
      THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
      DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
      YOU.
    </P>
    <H3>
      10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
    </H3>
    <P>
      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is
      defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
      "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer
      software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
      C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
      12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
      1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code
      with only those rights set forth herein.
    </P>
    <H3>
      11. MISCELLANEOUS.
    </H3>
    <P>
      This License represents the complete agreement concerning
      subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
      held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
      only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
      License shall be governed by California law provisions
      (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
      otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
      respect to disputes in which at least one party is a
      citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
      business in the United States of America, any litigation
      relating to this License shall be subject to the
      jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District
      of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
      California, with the losing party responsible for costs,
      including without limitation, court costs and reasonable
      attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
      of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
      provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
      against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
    </P>
    <H3>
      12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
    </H3>
    <P>
      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each
      party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
      directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights
      under this License and You agree to work with Initial
      Developer and Contributors to distribute such
      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is
      intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of
      liability.
    </P>
    <H3>
      13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
    </H3>
    <P>
      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered
      Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that
      the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of
      the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the
      alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial
      Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
